Over the past few days I worked on building a **full advnaced To-Do web app**, and honestly it was way more work than I expected 😂. I started with just a simple “add tasks” thing, but then I slowly kept adding more and more featuers until it kinda became a full mini–product on its own.

I added stuff like **search bar**, **filters for category and priority**, **pending/completed tabs**, and even **drag & drop sorting** for tasks (which took a while to get it working smoothly ngl). I also included **due dates**, **subtasks**, and a full **edit popup**, so users can actually change things later instead of deleting and retyping everything.

One thing I’m kinda proud of is the **dark/light theme toggle**, because it makes the app feel way more polished than I thought I could make. And oh yea— I also added **export and import** options, so all tasks can be saved as a JSON file and reloaded later. And ofc, everything is stored in **localStorage**, so tasks don’t disappear when refreshing the page (learned that the hard way lol).

The CSS part took some time too, since I wanted it to look clean but also modern-ish. I tried adding smooth animations, rounded corners, and a nice layout so the UI doesn’t look dull. Still not perfact, but definitley better than my old projects.

Overall, I think I learned a lot about **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, **state management**, and even some tricky stuff like drag positioning and modal logic. There were some bugs here and there (and probably still are 😂), but finishing this felt really good, like I actually built something useful from scratch.
